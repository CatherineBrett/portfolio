        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a mid-career changer who has accrued diverse experience in a
          variety of roles, including working for the picture desk of a national
          newspaper, in marketing for a chain of restaurants, for myself as a
          freelance translator, and more recently, in the voluntary sector as
          both an employee and a volunteer.
        </p>

        <!-- TO-DO: Elaborate on what led me to software engineering -->
        <p>
          I have loved aspects of all my previous roles and am now eager to find
          something that “has it all”. Since the pandemic, WFH has meant sharing
          a workspace with a software engineer, and this has given me an
          invaluable insight into the profession and its processes - stand-ups,
          sprints, retros etc. As someone who is motivated by effective
          collaboration, high performance, continuous learning and intellectual
          challenge, the field very much appeals.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a colleague, I'm adept at asking the right questions and at
          thinking ahead to forestall problems. Being a linguist, I'm a clear,
          adaptable communicator. I am looking forward to securing a position
          where I will be supported to understand my new craft inside out, and
          to constantly improve.
