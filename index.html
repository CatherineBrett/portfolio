        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a mid-career changer who has accrued diverse experience in a
          variety of roles, including working for the picture desk of a national
          newspaper, in marketing for a chain of restaurants, for myself as a
          freelance translator, and more recently, in the voluntary sector as
          both an employee and a volunteer.
        </p>

        <!-- TO-DO: Elaborate on what led me to software engineering -->
        <p>
          I have loved aspects of all my previous roles and am now eager to find
          something that “has it all”. Since the pandemic, WFH has meant sharing
          a workspace with a software engineer, and this has given me an
          invaluable insight into the profession and its processes - stand-ups,
          sprints, retros etc. As someone who is motivated by effective
          collaboration, high performance, continuous learning and intellectual
          challenge, the field very much appeals.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a colleague, I'm adept at asking the right questions and at
          thinking ahead to forestall problems. Being a linguist, I'm a clear,
          adaptable communicator. I am looking forward to securing a position
          where I will be supported to understand my new craft inside out, and
          to constantly improve.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp between
          January and April 2024. As part of the curriculum I built four
          projects which are outlined chronologically below:
        </p>
        <article>
          <h3>Project 1 (Solo) - Frogger</h3>
          <!-- TO-DO: Insert screenshot of Frogger here -->
          <picture> </picture>
          <p>
            Using DOM manipulation, I built a grid-based browser version of 80s
            arcade game Frogger in HTML, CSS and JavaScript across 6 business
            days (8 in total). My main challenges included animating the
            obstacles and detecting collisions with my player character. My
            stretch goals included a high score display and increasing the
            difficulty as the game progresses.

        <article>
          <h3>Project 2 (Pair) - Quiz App</h3>
          <!-- TO-DO: Insert screenshot of Quiz App here -->
          <picture> </picture>
          <p>
            Produced a React quiz app with TypeScript over a two-day hackathon.
            Our app consumed the Open Trivia public API, had a router with two
            “pages”, and was styled using the Bulma CSS framework. We mostly
            pair-programmed, taking turns as driver/navigator.

          <h3>Project 3 (Group of 3) - Bootcamp Buddy</h3>
          <!-- TO-DO: Insert screenshot of Bootcamp Buddy here -->
          <picture> </picture>
          <p>
            Built a full-stack “bootcamp advice” app over one week, using
            MongoDB, Express, React/TypeScript and Node.js. My contributions to
            this group project included providing the concept, implementing UI,
            writing some of the key logic for our CRUD functionality and
            producing some of the form validation and error handling.

          <h3>Project 4 (Solo) - Harborne Community Groups</h3>
          <!-- TO-DO: Insert screenshot of Harborne Community Groups here -->
          <picture> </picture>
          <p>
            Built a full-stack “community groups” app over 8 business days (12
            in total), using a Python Flask API with Flask REST framework to
            serve my data from a Postgres database. I built my frontend with
            React/TypeScript. The project has CRUD functionality, with various
            models and a mix of one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
